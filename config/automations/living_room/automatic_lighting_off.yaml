alias: Living Room Automatic Lighting Off
description: >-
  Turn off automatic living room lighting when a user made manual changes.

  It turns off a input_boolean when the lights are changed by a user.
  This allows me to know if the lights are manually overriden, so I can stop
  automating those lights. The input_boolean resets based on other factors,
  for example, the alarm got armed or after a certain time.
