alias: Attic Automatic Ventilation Off
description: >-
  Turn off automatic ventilation controls when a user made manual changes.

  It turns off a input_boolean when the light is changed by a user.
  This allows me to know if the fan is manually overriden, so I can stop
  automating the fan. The input_boolean resets based on other factors,
  for example, the alarm got armed or after a certain time.
